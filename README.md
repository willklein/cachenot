# README for cacheNot

This is a very simple Google Chrome extension to clear the browser cache with a
single button click. This relies on enabling the experimental API feature in
Google Chrome.

  * Visit chrome://flags.  Click Enable for "Experimental Extension APIs" and reload the browser.
  * Visit chrome://settings/extensions. Click Load unpacked extension and browse to the directory containing the extension files.
  * Use the extension by clicking on the trash icon.

There are a few more things I will be doing to polish/package the extension. If
the chrome.experimental.clear is ever made official (not experimental) I will
publish this on the Chrome Web Store. Until that happens, there's really no point.
